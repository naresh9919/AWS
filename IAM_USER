IAM USER :  Creating an IAM user in your AWS account


You can create one or more IAM users in your AWS account. You might create an IAM user when someone joins your team, or when you create a new application that needs to make API calls to AWS.

To create one or more IAM users (console)

Users --> Add users -->
programmatic access, access to the AWS Management Console, or both.
user name --> Custom password

Next: Permissions -->  Attach existing policies directly
Create policy
Choose Next: Tags.
Next: Review 
 Create user.
 
 To view the users' access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys), choose Show next to each password and access key that you want to see. To save the access keys, choose Download .csv and then save the file to a safe location.
